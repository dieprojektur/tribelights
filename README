== Knowledge Management Network

This web application is providing you with a means to share knowledge. We are convinced that Knowledge is Information
paired with Experience. In Knowledge Management, this is often neglected, and writing down explicit information is
winning over the need to communicate.

We are well aware that communication on a personal level is often impossible, especially in larger companies, or
distributed global companies, or in projects that span multiple apartments and/or companies. Therefor we want to provide
you with a simple means to communicate on large scales while collaboratively creating the information to keep to create
a pool of knowledge together with the social interaction necessary.

For a colorful world -
and better working environments:
