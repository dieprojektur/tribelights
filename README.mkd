# TRIBELIGHTS

> __Seth Godin about Tribes: "All they have in common is the desire to change things, the ability to connect a tribe,__
> __and the willingness to lead."__

Tribelights helps you to find and connect with people with the same desire and the willingness to lead. It needs a
tribe to make the change.
